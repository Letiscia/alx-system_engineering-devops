 SHELL REDIRECTION

Most command line programs that display their results do so by sending their results to a facility called standard output. By default, standard output directs its contents to the display. To redirect standard output to a file, the ">" character is used like this:

[me@linuxbox me]$ ls > file_list.txt
In this example, the ls command is executed and the results are written in a file named file_list.txt. Since the output of ls was redirected to the file, no results appear on the display.

Each time the command above is repeated, file_list.txt is overwritten from the beginning with the output of the command ls. To have the new results appended to the file instead, we use ">>" like this:

[me@linuxbox me]$ls >> file_list.txt
When the results are appended, the new results are added to the end of the file, thus making the file longer each time the command is repeated. If the file does not exist when we attempt to append the redirected output, the file will be created.
